# Portfolio
This is my portfolio where I will update my projects.

# 1. Fossil Analysis

Fossil analysis is my final project from the University of Helsinki MOOC course "Data Analysis with Python". In the project I fetch fossil data from the "New and Old Worlds" database, then I clean the data and perform different analysis methods on it. From the Fossil analysis folder, you can find everything related to the project. Raw data pulled from the database is in the .txt file and more cleaned data is in the .csv file. The project was done in Jupyter Notebook and analysis results can be seen at the end of the .ipnynb file. The whole project assignment and steps can be seen in the .pdf file in the Fossil Analysis folder.

# 1.1 Learning outcomes

This was my first time doing data analysis and there were ups and downs. Also, there were no premade tests to test if your solutions were correct. So everything I had to figure out myself. The first steps were pretty simple, they were more just tidying the data and getting it ready for more complex analysis. The most problems I had in the logistic regression part, I had no prior experience and I had some minor issues in the previous parts of the code. For help, I used chatGPT, StackOverflow, W3School, and other sources of the internet to get a better understanding of how things should work. In the end, I got everything working properly, and as a grade from peer reviewing the code I got 5/5. Criticism that I got from peer reviews focused on the code "style" in the Jupyter Notebook, and I agree that it is not the cleanest. This was my first time using the Notebook and I did the assignments one after another and printed the outcomes at the bottom of the project. First, this was clear but I noticed when more code was done it got a little bit messy. Also, the code could be more optimized, but it does what it is supposed to do and does it correctly. 

I learned a lot from this project and it was fun to do, even when I was bashing my head into a wall for a couple of days. I learned to get data, clean data, find meaningful things from data, perform analysis on the data, and find new connections between different things in the data. I learned more libraries in Python, how to use and what is Jupyter Notebook, and what is like to do a little bit more complex project.
